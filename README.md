**Monitoring and Mapping of Marine Habitat with Integrated Geomatics Technologies**

### Overview
The MANATEE project aims to develop and implement advanced, non-invasive monitoring methods for marine habitats using integrated geomatics technologies. üåç Funded under the PRIN 2022 program, MANATEE explores innovative solutions to observe and map underwater environments, integrating underwater photogrammetry with positioning and navigation systems based on acoustic, pressure, and inertial sensors. 

Our approach is implemented across three distinct underwater platforms, designed to monitor various habitat types at different depths, scales, and resolutions. The systems include:
- üê† **Observation UUV (Uncrewed Underwater Vehicle)**
- ü§ø **Low-cost micro ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle)**
- üì∏ **3D Survey Device for Divers**

These devices will be tested in real-world scenarios focusing on the encrusting coralline algae *Lithophyllum stictiforme*, a key habitat-forming species with a growth rate estimated at only a few millimeters per year.

### üåü Key Objectives
1. **Marine Habitat Monitoring**: Use geomatic technologies to monitor and map marine habitats, providing data on habitat health and evolution.
2. **3D Modeling**: Create high-resolution digital models of underwater habitats and extract metrics to track changes over time.
3. **Sensor Integration**: Develop a multi-sensor approach combining optical, acoustic, and inertial data to improve navigation and mapping precision.
4. **Guidelines Development**: Establish guidelines for implementing these monitoring procedures across protected marine areas.

### üß≠ Methodology
The MANATEE project adopts a **multi-resolution approach** to underwater positioning, navigation, and mapping, testing multiple vehicles across varying depths:
- ü§ø **VIP FROG Device for Divers**: Integrates a stereo camera system, pressure sensors, and inertial sensors, offering real-time feedback on data acquisition quality.
- üîµ **BlueROV2 for Medium Depths**: Utilizes low-cost stereovision cameras and an integrated USBL system to ensure precise navigation and localization at depths from 5 to 50 meters.
- ‚öì **Blucy UUV for Greater Depths**: Equipped with a high-resolution camera and multibeam sonar, Blucy performs detailed 3D mapping up to 250 meters.

### üß™ Experimental Activities
The project‚Äôs first field tests will take place in November 2024 off the coast of Costa Paradiso, Sardinia. Here, the team will simultaneously operate all three systems in the same area to assess and validate the data collected against traditional, invasive methods. Key tests include:
- üå± **Synthetic Algae Sample Modeling**: Using 3D printing to create modified versions of *Lithophyllum stictiforme* samples for photogrammetric analysis.

Starting from the photogrammetric survey of a dried thallus of Lithophyllum stictiforme, two slightly modified 3D-printed versions of the same sample were modeled. Modifications to the original model were made using digital sculpting techniques to simulate temporal changes in growth or reduction in the thallus structure. These two versions were also designed to be alternately fixed, using a forced-centering procedure, onto the same base, allowing them to be measured through a photogrammetric survey conducted with the three different vectors of the MANATEE project.

- üìê **Pressure Measurements in Controlled Conditions**: Testing pressure sensors in a hydraulic laboratory to verify their accuracy under simulated marine conditions.

A fundamental component of the VIP FROG system consists of custom-developed pressure and inertial sensors. These have the dual purpose of enhancing the photogrammetric survey by resolving scale ambiguity and establishing a vertical reference system, as well as providing hydrostatic leveling measurements to define control points for estimating any deformations in the photogrammetric model. We conducted two experimental tests at the Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory - LIDR maritime tank at the University of Bologna. The first series of experiments involved the sensor in static mode while various controlled sea states were generated. The purpose was to verify the sensor's ability to provide accurate depth measurements indirectly derived from pressure readings, even in wave motion. In the second series of tests, the sensor, synchronized with an underwater camera, provided information on the camera's depth while performing photogrammetric surveys under different sea conditions. The results are currently under further analysis. Still, preliminary findings confirm the potential of the proposed method both as a supplement to photogrammetric surveys and for hydrostatic control measurements.
