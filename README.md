### Overview
The MANATEE project aims to develop and implement advanced, non-invasive monitoring methods for marine habitats using integrated geomatics technologies. 🌍 Funded under the PRIN 2022 program, MANATEE explores innovative solutions to observe and map underwater environments, integrating underwater photogrammetry with positioning and navigation systems based on acoustic, pressure, and inertial sensors. 

Our approach is implemented across three distinct underwater platforms, designed to monitor various habitat types at different depths, scales, and resolutions. The systems include:
- 🐠 **Observation UUV (Uncrewed Underwater Vehicle)**
- 🤿 **Low-cost micro ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle)**
- 📸 **3D Survey Device for Divers**

These devices will be tested in real-world scenarios focusing on the encrusting coralline algae *Lithophyllum stictiforme*, a key habitat-forming species with a growth rate estimated at only a few millimeters per year.

### 🌟 Key Objectives
1. **Marine Habitat Monitoring**: Use geomatic technologies to monitor and map marine habitats, providing data on habitat health and evolution.
2. **3D Modeling**: Create high-resolution digital models of underwater habitats and extract metrics to track changes over time.
3. **Sensor Integration**: Develop a multi-sensor approach combining optical, acoustic, and inertial data to improve navigation and mapping precision.
4. **Guidelines Development**: Establish guidelines for implementing these monitoring procedures across protected marine areas.

### 🧭 Methodology
The MANATEE project adopts a **multi-resolution approach** to underwater positioning, navigation, and mapping, testing multiple vehicles across varying depths:
- 🤿 **VIP FROG Device for Divers**: Integrates a stereo camera system, pressure sensors, and inertial sensors, offering real-time feedback on data acquisition quality.
- 🔵 **BlueROV2 for Medium Depths**: Utilizes low-cost stereovision cameras and an integrated USBL system to ensure precise navigation and localization at depths from 5 to 50 meters.
- ⚓ **Blucy UUV for Greater Depths**: Equipped with a high-resolution camera and multibeam sonar, Blucy performs detailed 3D mapping up to 250 meters.

### 🧪 Experimental Activities
The project’s first field tests will take place in November 2024 off the coast of Costa Paradiso, Sardinia. Here, the team will simultaneously operate all three systems in the same area to assess and validate the data collected against traditional, invasive methods. Key tests include:
- 🌱 **Synthetic Algae Sample Modeling**: Using 3D printing to create modified versions of *Lithophyllum stictiforme* samples for photogrammetric analysis.
- 📐 **Pressure Measurements in Controlled Conditions**: Testing pressure sensors in a hydraulic laboratory to verify their accuracy under simulated marine conditions.

### 🌍 Expected Impact
The MANATEE project’s impact extends beyond environmental monitoring:
- 📊 **Open-Data Sharing**: Collected data will be shared with the scientific community, promoting open access to environmental data.
- 🖥️ **Virtual Reality**: Immersive technologies will help communicate the importance of marine habitat protection to the public.
- 🛠️ **Industrial Applications**: Insights from this project can support underwater monitoring for industrial purposes, such as infrastructure maintenance.
